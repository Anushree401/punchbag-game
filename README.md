# PunchBag game 
---
## About

This basic game was built in order to understand the fundamentals of VueJS.

VueJS is a javascript framework built for making single-page applications like this one. 
In this game, you can click on the punch button repeatedly until you see the punchbag burst. 
It uses minimal implementation of VueJS, just for pure understanding. 

If you wish to contribute to this or make it a legitimate game with advanced operations, you are free to suggest.
